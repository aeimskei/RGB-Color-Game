## Description:
A good tool to practice RGB colors because RGB systems are a bit unintuitive at first compared to most color systems that people are used to working with. So, let’s try to make learning it a little fun and challenging, yay! 

When you land on the page, you’ll get six random colors (they’re going to always change and be different. One of the color of the six, is lists in the large text above. Your goal is to find which of the six boxes below is that RGB color.

Remember, there are there channels: red, green and blue (each one ranges from 0 to 255).  With the mix of these three colors, we can pretty much make any color we want (black, white, yellow, orange, purple, etc. - all these are made with combining red, green, and blue -also called additive color mixing.

For example:

RBG(211, 206, 13)

R = 211
B = 206
G = 13

With this additive color mixing, R 211 is the highest, so this color has more red in the mix. So when we look down at the site color options, we know that in this mix, there is more red. We also know that there’s a lot of green because G is 206. And finally for blue, B is only 13. So, there’s a lot of red and a lot of green = a yellowish brown color right? Look at the additive color mixing diagram.

For the ones you correct wrong, the clock is going to look like it disappeared and it’ll tell you in the prompt above to try again. Until you guess the correct one.

When you click the correct color, all of the six color squares/boxes are going to change to the correct color. Including the background of the top ban above. The message is also going to prompt “Correct!”

If you want, you can click play again, and it’ll generate new colors, the ban background color is gonna go back to blue and you get six new squares and a new random color to guess.

You can also change the difficulty between easy and hard. If you want easier, you’ll only have three to pick from. With hard, you’ll have six.

Also, this is a responsive site.
